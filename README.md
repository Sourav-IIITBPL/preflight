## What is PreFlight?

**PreFlight is a transaction-level integrity firewall that runs before your DeFi transaction executes.**

It is not a price oracle, or a monitoring dashboard. It is a **pre-execution verifier**: given exact calldata, exact block state, and exact user intent — it tells you whether that transaction is safe to submit. Every decision is explainable, reproducible, and backed by on-chain evidence.

Unlike price previews or slippage warnings, PreFlight:

- Executes the inbuilt on-chain guards
- Simulates the exact calldata
- Analyzes the execution trace
- Verifies accounting invariants
- Detects manipulation patterns
- Enforces explainable security policy
```js
[ User Signs Intent ] ──► [ PreFlight Verification ] ──► [ Execute on Arbitrum ]
                                      ↕
                            Guards + CRE Simulation
                            + Trace Analysis + Policy
```

---

## The Problem

Users lose funds even when:

- UI preview looks correct  
- Slippage is reasonable  
- Protocol is audited  
- MEV protection is enabled  

Because:
- Flash-loan manipulation distorts state  
- Routers use hidden delegatecalls  
- Vault exchange rates are manipulated  
- Internal calls redirect funds
- Runtime state manipulation

** Existing tools only check math — not execution**  
***PreFlight checks execution integrity.***

PreFlight fills this gap. It operates between **sign** and **execute** — the only window these tools leave unguarded.

```js
[ Sign Transaction ] → [ PreFlight Verification ] → [ Execute ]
```

---

## Core Abstraction

A transaction is safe **if and only if**:

> *The observable on-chain state, execution trace, and accounting invariants match the user's intent within defined risk bounds.*

PreFlight enforces this across three independent layers:

| Layer | What It Verifies | How |
|---|---|---|
| **State Integrity** | On-chain state is not manipulated | Deterministic `view`-only Guard contracts |
| **Execution Integrity** | What *will* happen when the tx runs | Chainlink CRE forks Arbitrum and simulates |
| **Accounting Integrity** | Balance deltas match intent | Trace analysis + invariant math |

---


# Architecture

PreFlight enforces strict separation of concerns.

## How It Works

PreFlight enforces **transaction-level integrity verification** in four structured stages:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A([👤 User Intent]) --> B[PreFlightRouter]

    B --> C[On-Chain Guards<br/>SwapV2Guard / LiquidityGuard / VaultGuard]
    C -->|Structured Signals| P[Policy.sol]

    P --> D[Chainlink CRE Simulation]
    D --> E[Trace Analysis]
    E -->|Structured Signals| P

    P --> F{Final Aggregation}

    F -->|CRITICAL| X([⛔ Abort])
    F -->|WARN| G([⚠️ User Confirmation])
    F -->|PASS| H([✅ Execute Transaction])

    F --> R([🧾 NFT Risk Report])

    style X fill:#ef4444,color:#fff
    style H fill:#22c55e,color:#fff
    style G fill:#f59e0b,color:#fff
```

**Step 1 — On-chain Guards (Fast, Deterministic):** `PreFlightRouter` calls view functions on `SwapV2Guard`, `LiquidityGuard`, and `VaultGuard`. These are cheap, `view`-only reads against live on-chain state: TWAP deviation, reserve deltas, token mintability, exchange rate spikes etc. All the warning signals generated during checks , are passed to `Policy.sol` for final aggregation.

**Step 2 — Chainlink CRE Simulation (Deep Verification):** This works as an off-chain guard mechanism . After on-chain checks,  the transaction is forwarded to Chainlink CRE . CRE performs:
1. Fork Arbitrum at the current block  
2. Execute exact user calldata  
3. Capture full execution trace  
4. Compute balance deltas  
5. Analyze invariant violations  

Trace-level detections include:

- `DELEGATECALL` to unknown targets  
- `SELFDESTRUCT` in call path  
- Unexpected third-party transfers  
- Hidden approval escalations  
- Accounting inconsistencies  
- Donation / inflation patterns  

All simulation-derived signals are emitted in structured format and forwarded to `Policy.sol`.

**Step 3 — Decision Engine (Policy.sol):** `Policy.sol` is the single aggregation layer. It aggregates all structured signals based on severity, and confidence levels . these are then presented into a final report format — no black-box scoring.

**Step 4 — NFT Risk Report (Verifiable Evidence):** The final aggregated report is presented to user in NFT form . User gets the full analyses and has the option to whether to acknowledge the risks and proceed the transaction or revert the transaction .

## Chainlink Integration

PreFlight's depth is entirely powered by Chainlink infrastructure.

### Chainlink CRE — Off-Chain Transaction Simulation
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User Calldata] --> B[Chainlink CRE Job]
    B --> C[Fork Arbitrum @ Block N]
    C --> D[Execute eth_call]
    D --> E[Capture Execution Trace]
    E --> F{Trace Analyzer}

    F --> G[Internal CALLs]
    F --> H[DELEGATECALL targets]
    F --> I[ERC-20 transfer deltas]
    F --> J[Storage writes]
    F --> K[Balance snapshots]

    G & H & I & J & K --> L[Reason Codes + Safety Score]
```

Using CRE means simulation is **deterministic**, **attestable**, and not dependent on a centralized backend. Results can be referenced in on-chain decisions and embedded in NFT report metadata.

### Chainlink Automation — Real-Time TWAP Maintenance

`SwapV2Guard.spotVsTwap()` is the primary flash-loan detection mechanism. It compares spot price against a historical TWAP — which is only trustworthy if maintained by a reliable, trust-minimized keeper.
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Chainlink Automation Upkeep] --> B[Read AMM spot price]
    B --> C[Append to TWAP checkpoint array]
    C --> D[Write to on-chain storage]
    D --> E[SwapGuard reads checkpoint]
    E --> F{Deviation > threshold?}
    F -- YES --> G[🚫 Flash manipulation detected]
    F -- NO --> H[✅ Price stable — proceed]
```

Automation runs the TWAP upkeep on a per-pool configurable interval — no centralized cron job, no trust assumption.

## Security Modules

PreFlight protects four DeFi actions on Arbitrum. Each has a defined threat model, invariants, and abort conditions.

### SwapV2Guard

| Check | Layer | Abort Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical router | On-chain | Not in registry → CRITICAL |
| Spot vs TWAP | On-chain (Automation-fed) | >1% stable / >5% major pool → BLOCK |
| Reserve delta | On-chain | >10% change since last block → flash loan |
| Min liquidity | On-chain | TVL < $20k + trade > 1% TVL → BLOCK |
| Token mintability | On-chain | Owner-mintable detected → WARN |
| Simulated vs quoted output | CRE | Below slippage threshold → BLOCK |
| Fee-on-transfer | CRE Trace | Received < quoted → HIGH RISK |
| Third-party transfer | CRE Trace | Funds to unknown address → CRITICAL |
| Delegatecall to unknown | CRE Trace | Unknown target → CRITICAL |

### LiquidityGuard

| Check | Layer | Abort Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Token mintable | On-chain | Exposes mint/owner → WARN |
| Pair creation age | On-chain | < 1000 blocks old → WARN |
| Canonical router | On-chain | Not whitelisted → CRITICAL |
| Approval flow | CRE Trace | Approval to unexpected address → CRITICAL |
| LP mint destination | Backend | LP minted to unknown address → HIGH |
| Simulate add correctness | CRE | Tokens not credited to user → BLOCK |
| LP transfer restriction | On-chain | Honeypot LP detected → WARN |
| Withdrawal external calls | CRE Trace | Arbitrary call during exit → CRITICAL |

### VaultGuard (ERC-4626)

| Check | Layer | Abort Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Exchange rate delta | On-chain | >2% WARN / >10% BLOCK |
| Assets balance mismatch | On-chain | `balanceOf ≠ totalAssets` → CRITICAL |
| Total assets jump | On-chain | Jump without supply change → CRITICAL |
| Admin hook on deposit | CRE Trace | Admin function fires during user flow → CRITICAL |
| Withdraw path delegatecall | CRE Trace | Delegatecall during exit → CRITICAL |
| Simulate deposit shares | CRE | Shares received < expected → BLOCK |
| Reentrancy pattern | CRE Trace | Balance modified mid-flow → CRITICAL |

## Risk Reports & Soulbound NFT

Every scan can produce one **Soulbound NFT** — a tamper-proof, IPFS-linked proof of the pre-execution analysis. Minting is always opt-in and consent-gated.
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Scan Completes] --> B[Full Report JSON]
    B --> C[Pin to IPFS → CID]
    B --> D[SHA-256 hash → ReportRegistry.sol]
    C & D --> E{User clicks Mint Proof}
    E --> F[RiskReportNFT.sol mints SBT]
    F --> G["owner: msg.sender | ipfsCID: Qm... | reportHash: bytes32 | transferable: false"]
```

One NFT per scan. Non-transferable. The report CID contains the full trace, all reason codes, and a Foundry reproduction script — making every block decision independently verifiable by auditors or judges.

---

## Design Principles

Every guard is `view`-only, deterministic, and maps to a canonical reason code. There are no magic scores, no auto-approvals, and no dark patterns. Heavy heuristics live in the CRE simulation layer — never on-chain.

The architecture is intentionally modular: adding a new protocol requires only a new adapter. Adding a new check requires only a new guard function. Nothing else changes. Every decision is defensible to a judge, auditor, or protocol team.

This is how production DeFi security infrastructure is built.
